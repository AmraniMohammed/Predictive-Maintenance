# Predictive Maintenance

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive maintenance model that can predict when equipment is likely to fail, allowing organizations to proactively schedule maintenance before a failure occurs. Predictive maintenance can help organizations reduce downtime, increase equipment lifespan, and improve overall operational efficiency.
